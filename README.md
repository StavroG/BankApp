# BankApp
This was a basic Java App I built in my second semester of my freshman year.
It is a Java app that runs in the console.

What I learend:
  1. How to use interfaces and super classes in Java. 
  2. How to use datastructers like arraylists.
  3. How to make a basic interactive app using the console.
